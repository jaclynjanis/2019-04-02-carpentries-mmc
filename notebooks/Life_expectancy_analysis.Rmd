##Analysis of Life Expectancy by Continent

We hypothesize that life expectancy is a function of time and location.


**This is not a real analysis. This is all just an example of RMarkdown.**

```{r, message = FALSE}
#Read in data
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
d <- readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))

d %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

You can use R code in line. The data consist of years from `r range(d$year)`.



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
